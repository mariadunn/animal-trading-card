			<p class="animal_description post_it">The sawfish is a type of ray found in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions. The rostrum (snout) of the sawfish is used to detect and kill its prey, as well as defending itself against predators. Although fearsome-looking, sawfish are generally docile and pose little threat to humans. Their rostrums are prized in several cultures across the world.</p>
